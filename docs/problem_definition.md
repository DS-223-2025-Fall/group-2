# Problem Definition

## 1. Identify the Problem Area
The project is part of the **Product Development and Customer Experience** area of marketing. It focuses on solving the difficulties readers in **Yerevan** face when trying to find and buy books from local bookstores.  

Since local stores have separate websites, it is hard for people to:

- Check where a book is available

- Compare prices

- Find good options for reading or gifting  

This lack of centralized information reduces local bookstore sales and increases reliance on foreign online retailers.

## 2. Conduct Preliminary Research
Preliminary research reveals that:

- Many Yerevan bookstores, such as **Bookinist** and **Zangak**, have separate online platforms that are not integrated, making it difficult for customers to know where a specific book is available or at what price.
- Customers often spend considerable time comparing availability and prices across different stores or end up ordering from international websites, increasing waiting time and costs.
- Recommender systems and product-matching algorithms are widely used in e-commerce but are rarely applied to local offline bookstores.
- Studies show that personalized recommendation systems and price optimization significantly improve customer satisfaction and local business engagement.

**Opportunity:** Create a unified platform that enhances book discovery and supports local retail through intelligent search and recommendation.

## 3. Define a Specific Problem
**Problem Statement:**  
How can we design a **data-driven recommendation platform** that allows users to find the availability, price, and location of a desired book in Yerevan, and if unavailable, suggests the most similar locally available books based on plot, genre, and description?
